# Simple Notes App

A simple and intuitive Notes App built using Flutter and Dart. The app allows you to add, view, edit, and delete notes with ease. This is my first project where i used Flutter SDK and the Dart Programming language.

## Features

- Add a new note by clicking on the blue floating action button at the bottom right.
- View all your notes as stacked cards below each other.
- Edit existing notes by tapping on the note card's pen icon.
- Delete notes by clicking on the bin icon.

## Getting Started

To run the app on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Flutter installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Open the project in your favorite IDE (Android Studio, Visual Studio Code, etc.).
4. Connect your Android or iOS device or launch an emulator.
5. Run the app using the `flutter run` command.

## Dependencies

The app uses the following dependencies:

- `flutter/material`: The Flutter material library for UI components.
- `flutter/cupertino`: The Flutter Cupertino widgets for iOS-style design.
- `flutter/widgets`: The base Flutter widgets.
- `fluttertoast`: A plugin for showing toasts in Flutter.
