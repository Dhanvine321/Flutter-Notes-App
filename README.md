# Notes App
A Notes App built using Flutter and Dart as my first Flutter project. The app allows users to create, view, edit, and delete notes. It also includes a login page for user authentication, and a profile page to display user account details. As of now there is no real authentication and all implememnted but soon might add it when I have the time. Profile page too has be updated to improve aesthetics and UI.

## Features

- Create a new note with a title and content and even a due date.
- View the list of all created notes in the home page.
- Edit existing notes.
- Delete notes.
- Login with username and password.
- Display user account details on the profile page.
